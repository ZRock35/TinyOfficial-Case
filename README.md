## TinyOfficial SlimeVR Case
*My edits of Gorbit99's TinySlime case to fit the Official SlimeVR PCB and battery, and of Pixel's clip design that works with it!*

* Very simple and tiny PCB case, designed to fit the Official SlimeVR PCB and battery with no modifications needed.
* Open or closed top option, with clip on feature allowing for easy removing.
* BNO085 Official PCB
* SlimeVR's default standard Battery.
* I used PLA for this without issues.
* Additional details for printing, if needed, can be found on Gorbit99's TinySlime repository!
